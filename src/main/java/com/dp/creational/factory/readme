FACTORY PATTERN AND OPEN CLOSE PRINCIPLE

http://java.globinch.com/patterns/design-patterns/factory-design-patterns-and-open-closed-principle-ocp-in-solid/#Open-Closed-Principle

The factory pattern (also known as the factory method pattern) is a creational 
design pattern. 

A factory is a JavaSW class that is used to encapsulate object creation code.

Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses

A factory class instantiates and returns a particular type of object based on data passed to the factory. 
The different types of objects that are returned from a factory typically are subclasses of a common parent class.
