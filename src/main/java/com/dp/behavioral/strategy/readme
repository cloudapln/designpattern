The strategy pattern is a behavioral object design pattern. In the
strategy pattern,
different algorithms are represented as Concrete Strategy classes,
and they share a
common Strategy interface.

A Context object contains a reference to a Strategy. By changing the Context's
Strategy,
different behaviors can be obtained.

The strategy pattern is one way that composition can be used as an alternative
to subclassing
