The chain of responsibility pattern is a behavioral object design pattern.

In the chain of responsibility pattern, a series of handler objects are chained together 
to handle a request made by a client object.
  
If the first handler can't handle the request, the request is forwarded to the next handler,
and it is passed down the chain until the request reaches a handler that can handle the 
request or the chain ends. 
   
The Java Servlet filter framework is an example of chain of resposibility design.
 Java exception handling is another example of chain of responsibility design.
